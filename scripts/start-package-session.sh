#
# Starts one headless lower-plugin session for one work package and waits for it to
# end. Which lower plugin is decided by the package's lane (see --lane below). This is the `run` skill's only way of dispatching work; the
# skill calls it with `Bash(run_in_background: true)` from its own turn and is woken
# by the harness when the process exits.
#
# Why a script and not an inline command in SKILL.md: the launch lock, the stream
# redirection and the exit marker are mechanics, not judgement. A skill that has to
# reproduce them from prose gets them subtly wrong; a script gets them right every
# time and can be tested on its own.
#
# Usage:
#   start-package-session.sh [--lane code|prose] <project_id> <package> <worktree_path> <base_branch> <attempt> [<run_root>]
#   start-package-session.sh --gatekeeper-split <project_id> <ticket_id> <main_checkout> [<run_root>]
#
# Lane: `code` (the default -- a call without --lane behaves exactly as before) starts
# /agent-autonomous-developer:process-developer; `prose` (a package ticket carrying the
# `lane:prose` label) starts /agent-autonomous-prompt-engineer:process-prompt-engineer.
# The lane -> entry table lives here and nowhere else: the caller passes a lane, never
# a skill name, so no free-form string ever reaches a bypassPermissions prompt. Both
# entries take the same parameters and speak the same adev:event v1 contract; nothing
# else in this script depends on the lane.
#
# Gatekeeper-split mode (#53): `--gatekeeper-split <project_id> <ticket_id>
# <main_checkout> [<run_root>]` starts one headless gatekeeper pass for exactly one
# named ticket, cwd = the project's *main checkout* (never a worktree -- there is no
# base branch, no attempt, nothing to review). The entry is a fixed literal
# (GATEKEEPER_SPLIT_ENTRY below), never caller-supplied, and it is deliberately kept
# out of the `--lane` case so `--lane gatekeeper` can never reach it. `ticket_id` and
# `project_id` are validated before anything is created or started, the same
# lock/RUNDIR/flag plumbing as a package session runs the process, and the run
# directory is named `split-<ticket>-...` (not `pkg-...`) so it is never mistaken for
# a package session's run dir. See .adev/53-1/plan.md; the flow that calls this mode
# (triage marker, gatekeeper/run wiring) is #57, out of scope here.
#
# Prints `RUNDIR=<dir>` first, then `COST_USD=<v>`, `DURATION_MS=<v>`, `TURNS=<v>`,
# then `EXIT=<code>` last. Exit code = the session's.
# Writes <rundir>/stream.jsonl, <rundir>/stderr.txt, <rundir>/exit_code.
#
# COST_USD/DURATION_MS/TURNS (#65): read from the session's own final `"type":"result"`
# record in stream.jsonl (its `total_cost_usd`/`duration_ms`/`num_turns` fields) with
# grep+sed -- no interpreter dependency, since `python`/`python3` naming differs between
# Git Bash on Windows and the Ubuntu CI runner, and the script already parses the stream
# this way for the launch-lock's `"type":"system"` check. Only the *last* line whose
# `"type"` is `"result"` is examined (`grep | tail -n 1`), so an escaped decoy of the
# same key name inside an assistant message's text (`\"total_cost_usd\":...`) never
# matches -- the key-quote is preceded by a backslash there, not `{`/`,`. No result
# record, or a key missing from it, reports that value as an empty string, never a
# missing line.
#
# Model: pinned via --model, default `sonnet`, override with the environment
# variable ADEV_SESSION_MODEL. Pinning is not a preference, it is a correctness
# property: without --model the headless session inherits whatever `/model` the
# human last left set in their interactive session, so the same package costs a
# different amount depending on a setting nobody involved in the run can see.
# Measured over the 2026-08-23/24 runs, the main turn was 33% of a package's
# cost on Sonnet and 52% on Opus -- same pipeline, same work, one forgotten
# toggle. The six subagents already pin their own model in their frontmatter
# (`planner: opus`, the rest `sonnet`); this line closes the last gap. The main
# turn sequences phases, counts rounds, posts events and drives git/PR/CI -- it
# delegates every judgement that needs a bigger model to a subagent that names
# one.
#
# Budget: there is deliberately no `--max-budget-usd`. See AGENTS.md,
# "No dollar budget on the package session".
#
# Launch lock: concurrent `claude` starts corrupt ~/.claude.json (anthropics/claude-code
# #28813, #28847). The lock is a directory (`mkdir` is atomic on NTFS and POSIX), carries
# the owner PID, is broken if the owner is dead or it is older than 60 s, and is held
# only until the new process has read its config (first `system` line in the stream)
# or 25 s -- never across the run.
