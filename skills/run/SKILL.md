description: Unattended night-shift runner — before enumerating, finishes any CI-green PR an earlier run left unmerged; then orders every open package in the board's Todo column by its blocked_by relations (a blocker also in Todo is processed first; a package whose blocker is still open elsewhere is skipped, left untouched in Todo, and reported), gives each its own worktree, hands it to agent-autonomous-developer in a separate claude -p process started from this skill's own turn, and merges the CI-green PR. A merge conflict gets one rebase-and-retry round (mechanical, absorbed here) before it escalates; a package that only died mid-CI-wait is checked directly (get_pr/list_pipeline_runs) before its retry is spent, never escalated for waiting alone; a blocked event is triaged (a read-only subagent tries to answer it from ticket and code) before it costs a retry; branch protection, a missing permission, and an unresolved mergeability state comment on the ticket and escalate to Question; a project without pulls.merge is refused up front, before anything is touched. Sequential, no human in the loop, may run for hours. Installed per project; invoke as "/agent-ticket-orchestrator:run" from the project's main checkout (project_id=<id> overrides the repo-derived id).

# run — process every Todo package to a merged, CI-green PR

You are the unattended executor. Nobody is watching; you may run all night.
You pull packages from **Todo**, drive each one through its lower plugin
(`agent-autonomous-developer`, or `agent-autonomous-prompt-engineer` for a
package labelled `lane:prose` — see step 2b) in its own worktree and its own
`claude -p` process, and record its state with column writes plus one close:
`Todo → Doing → closed` (the package ticket is closed after its PR merged),
or `→ Question` when a human decision is genuinely needed. A finished package
is a **closed ticket**, never a column: this skill neither writes nor reads a
`Done` column. `Done` survives only as a result word in the final report,
where it names an outcome.

**Comments are the log, columns are the signal.** You never read a subagent's
prose to learn what happened — you read the latest `adev:event` comment on
the package ticket. You never produce code, plans, or diffs, and you never
carry any project content in your context.

## Inputs

- `project_id` — **optional; resolved from the repository you are in.** This
  plugin is installed per project and runs from that project's main checkout.
  Resolution, in this order: an explicit `project_id=<id>` argument wins;
  otherwise run `git remote get-url origin`, reduce it to `owner/repo`
  (`git@github.com:owner/repo.git` → `owner/repo`; `https://…/owner/repo.git`
  → `owner/repo`), call `search_projects(query="<owner/repo>", limit=5)` and
  take the single result whose `path` equals it exactly. Pass its `id` on
  **verbatim** (case rules: `search_projects`' tool description). No match
  or more than one → STOP and say which repo you resolved and which
  configured ids `list_projects(fields="light")` returned — never pick one.
  Thread the resolved id into every MCP call and every subagent prompt. This
  skill reads `path`, `permissions` and `local_path` from the resolved entry.
- **Inside a project there is no parallelism**: one package, one worktree,
  one process at a time. Parallel `claude` starts race on `~/.claude.json`
  and parallel worktrees race on shared services; the night is long enough.
  Orchestration *across* projects (release chains, version bumps) is not this
  plugin's job — it runs one project's board.
- Optional `model` for the package process (default `sonnet`), passed as
  `ADEV_SESSION_MODEL=<model>` in front of the script call. The subagents inside
  the package session pin their own models; this is only the session's own
  orchestrating turn, which sequences phases, counts rounds, posts events and
  drives git/PR/CI. Pinning it at all is the point — an unpinned session
  inherits whatever `/model` the human last left set.
- **No dollar budget.** There is no `budget_usd` and no `--max-budget-usd`; the
  platform's own session limits are the only ceiling. See *Why there is no
  dollar budget* below.

## Preconditions (per project)

1. **MCPs loaded.** `agent-project-issues` and `agent-worktree` tools must be
   available. If not, **STOP** and tell the user to `/reload-plugins`.
2. **Board columns.** `list_board_columns(project_id)` must contain the logical
   columns `Todo`, `Doing`, `Question`. Keep the
   `logical → native` map; every column write uses the *native* value. Missing
   column → STOP for this project with the missing name. Existing boards
   that still carry an extra column keep it: this skill neither reads nor
   requires it — that includes a leftover finished-work column.
3. **Merge permission.** From the resolved project entry read `permissions.pulls.merge`.
   If `pulls.merge` is `false`, STOP for this project before Step 0 and tell the user to use
   `/agent-autonomous-developer:process-developer` for single tickets instead.
   Nothing was touched: no column moved, no worktree created, no session started.
4. **Repo root.** `local_path` from the resolved project entry must exist on disk and be
   a git checkout; the default branch is `git -C <local_path> symbolic-ref
   --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (fallback: `main`). `worktree_create`
   fetches `origin` itself.
5. **Settings committed.** Run exactly this and read both its output and its exit code:

   ```
   git -C <local_path> status --porcelain --untracked-files=all --ignored -- .claude/settings.json
   ```

   - **Exit 0 and empty output** → the file matches `HEAD`; continue.
   - **Exit 0 and any output line** (` M` modified, `??` never committed, `!!` present but
     gitignored, ` D` deleted, or any other status) → STOP for this project before Step 0.
     Tell the user that `.claude/settings.json` in `<local_path>` is not committed, quote
     git's output lines verbatim, and say why that matters: every worktree this skill cuts
     is checked out from a committed ref, so every package session would load the
     committed plugin set, not the one this checkout shows. Commit or revert the file,
     then re-run.
   - **Non-zero exit** → STOP for this project before Step 0 the same way, quoting git's
     error. A check that could not run is never read as clean.

   Nothing was touched: no column moved, no worktree created, no session started.
   Only this one file is checked: `.claude/settings.local.json` is untracked by design and
   never reaches a worktree anyway. Once this precondition holds, the file
   `prose-lane-available.py` reads in step 2b is the same committed file the package
   session gets, so its verdict is the session's truth.

## Flow per project

### 0. Pre-flight — finish what an earlier run left open

```
open_prs = list_prs(project_id, status="open", omit_body=True, omit_nulls=True, limit=50)
```

Keep the entries whose head branch starts with `pkg/`. Each one is an earlier
run's package that never merged, and each one is a base this run's worktrees
will **not** contain. For each, in board order: recover the package id from
`pkg/<id>-<slug>` and read its latest `adev:event`
(`list_comments(project_id, ticket_id=<package>, order="desc", limit=3, body_max_chars=600)`;
take the first comment containing `<!-- adev:event`. If none of the three
carries it, repeat once with `limit=10` (same `body_max_chars`) before
concluding no terminal event).

- **Latest event is `ci-green`** → finish it now: run the full **2c
  `ci-green`** reaction below, classification and rebase retry included.
  This is not a decision, it is yesterday's unfinished job — and it is
  exactly the state the 2026-08-24 incident got stuck in (see *Merge outcomes
  are classified, and a conflict is a retry* below).
- **Anything else** (`blocked`, `failed`, `pr-opened`, `ci-red`, or the card
  already sits in **Question**) → leave it alone. Record
  `carried over: PR #<n>, package <id>, latest event <e>` in the report.

**Never abort the run because a carried-over PR could not be closed out.** An
unattended night that stops for one stuck card is worth less than a night
that finishes the other seven. Instead, state the consequence once, here and
in the report: every open `pkg/*` PR left standing is a base this run's own
packages do not contain, so conflicts against it are *expected* downstream —
and the conflict retry in 2c is exactly what absorbs them. That is why the
two halves of this change belong together.

### 1. Enumerate

```
packages = list_tickets(project_id, column="Todo", status="open", limit=100, omit_body=True)
```

**Only Todo.** Never read Backlog or Planned as candidates — those columns are
the human's staging area and the gatekeeper's output; what is in Todo is what
the human released. Process in board order (oldest first), reordered by
dependency as described next. Steps 1 and 1a are not a one-time pass: they
run again at the head of every Step 2 iteration, over the Todo of that moment,
so a ticket that lands in Todo during the run is ordered like any other.

### 1a. Order Todo by dependency

```
1. board_order = the Todo tickets from this iteration's Step 1, oldest first,
   minus every package this run already processed or skipped (a split
   original stays in — see Step 2).
2. For each package p not read earlier in this run, one call:
     get_ticket(project_id, p, include_relations=True, include_comments=False)
   blockers[p] = [r.ticket_id for r in relations if r.kind == "blocked_by"]
   blockers[p] and the labels are memoised for the whole run, with one
   exception: when a split lands on p (2c), drop p's memo, because the split
   added p's blocked_by on its code half.
   Only on a provider whose list_relation_kinds provider_support lacks
   blocked_by, ALSO read the newest "## Dependency (gatekeeper)" comment's
   <!-- gatekeeper:deps v1 ... --> block via `list_comments(project_id,
   ticket_id=p, order="desc", limit=10, body_max_chars=600)` and take its
   blocked_by: line — same dumb key: value reader as adev:event, one more
   block, no new mechanism.
3. Classify every blocker b on every pass. Only whether b is resolved is
   memoised per b for the whole run, and done_this_run is checked first, so
   a blocker this run closed counts as resolved even if an earlier pass
   found it open (see "When is a blocker resolved" below):
     - b resolved            -> drop the edge
     - b in board_order      -> INTERNAL edge, orderable inside this run
     - otherwise             -> EXTERNAL-OPEN
4. Every package with an EXTERNAL-OPEN blocker is SKIPPED for the rest of
   this run. Remove it from the graph; do not move its card; report
   `skipped: blocked by #<b> (not closed)` once.
5. Topological order over what remains, INTERNAL edges only — Kahn with a
   board-order tie-break, and no other heuristic:
     ready = packages with no unsatisfied blocker, in board order
     repeat: emit the FIRST of ready (board order); re-evaluate the packages
             it unblocked; merge them back into ready keeping board order
   Deterministic, and the only reordering this skill ever performs. There is
   no priority field, no "smallest first", nothing else.
6. Transitive skip: a package whose only blocker was itself SKIPPED is
   SKIPPED too — `skipped: blocker #<b> skipped`.
7. Cycle. Anything still unemitted when `ready` runs empty is in a cycle or
   downstream of one. Emit those at the very END, in board order, and record
   one line: `dependency cycle: #a -> #b -> #a, processed in board order` —
   once per run, the first pass that finds the cycle; a later pass that finds
   it again adds no second line.
   NEVER drop a package and NEVER abort the run for a cycle: a cycle is a
   human's ten-second fix on the board, and losing a night's other seven
   packages to it is the failure mode this skill exists to avoid.
```

Reading a blocker's ticket by id is not "touching Backlog or Planned". That
rule forbids *selecting candidates from* and *writing to* those columns; it
has never forbidden looking at one ticket you were pointed at. `run` still
enumerates Todo only and still writes nothing outside Todo → Doing →
closed/Question.

### When is a blocker resolved

A blocker `#b` is **resolved** exactly when it is closed. Decide it like this:

1. `#b` is in `done_this_run` — the set of package tickets this skill closed
   itself earlier in this very run → resolved. The set is authoritative and
   needs no re-read.
2. Otherwise read it once:
   `get_ticket(project_id, #b, include_comments=False, include_relations=False)`.
3. `#b` is `status: closed` → resolved, however it came to be closed: closed
   by this skill after its merge, an epic child closed by the `Closes #<n>`
   line in its epic's PR, or a duplicate, wontfix or hand-closed ticket.

Everything open is **not** resolved, whatever its column — `Todo`, `Doing`,
`Question`, `Backlog`, `Planned` — and so is a ticket that cannot be found.
Closed alone is enough because this skill closes every package ticket it
finishes, an epic included, so no finished work stays open; no column is
consulted.

One `get_ticket` per distinct blocker per run, memoised. Nothing here polls.

### 2. Per package, sequentially

**Step 2 is a loop, and every iteration starts from a fresh order.** At the
head of each iteration, run Step 1 and Step 1a again over the Todo of that
moment. Take the first package of that order: it is never one this run
already processed or skipped, with one exception — a split original (2c,
*Blocked events are triaged*), which may be taken once more after its split
landed. Run steps a–d for it, then start the next iteration.

**The loop ends only when a freshly built order leaves nothing to dispatch:**
Todo is empty, or every ticket still in it is one this run skipped — its
blocker is not closed, or its skip reason cannot change inside this run
(`prose lane not installed`, `branch check failed`; memoised for the run).
Then write the Step 3 report. The loop always ends: every dispatch takes its
package out of Todo, and only a split original comes back, at most once per
ticket ever.

**Why strictly one at a time, merge before next:** every package's PR is
merged by you on `ci-green` *before* the next package's worktree is created,
and that worktree is cut from the **post-merge** default branch
(`worktree_create` fetches `origin` first). So at no point do two open PRs
coexist, and a later package can never conflict with an earlier one — the
conflict that a human would otherwise inherit after merging PR 1 of 3 cannot
arise. This guarantee only holds while `run` merges itself, which is why
Precondition 3 refuses a project with `pulls.merge: false` instead of letting
packages pile up unmerged. It is stated here so nobody "fixes" it by
parallelising.

The guarantee is only worth something if it is **verified**, not assumed —
step **a** below checks the previous package actually cleared before cutting
the next worktree. When it did not, `run` does not stop the night for it: it
proceeds and records the violation, because the merge-outcome classification
in 2c is exactly what absorbs the resulting conflicts. See *Merge outcomes
are classified, and a conflict is a retry* below.

**a. Claim + worktree.**

**Re-check blockers at dispatch time.** Re-read `blockers[p]` one last time,
against the same resolved test as 1a. The order was rebuilt just before this
pick, so this re-check is the guard for the one package chosen, not the
ordering itself.

- Every blocker resolved → proceed exactly as below.
- A blocker that was in Todo was **not** closed by this run — you left it in
  `Question` or `Doing` → **skip this package**. Leave the card in
  **Todo**, do not move it to Doing, do not cut a worktree, do not start a
  session, and record `skipped: blocker #<b> ended in <column>`. Then
  start the next iteration. This is the
  blocker-in-Todo-that-did-not-land case, and it degrades to the ordinary
  skip on purpose: a package whose precondition did not land is exactly as
  un-runnable as one whose blocker was never in Todo at all.

A skip is never an abort and never a Question. Record it and continue — the
same rule as every other failure mode in this skill.

**A `lane:prose` package needs the prose lane installed.** The prompt
engineer is an optional plugin, not a dependency. For a package carrying
`lane:prose`, run
`python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gatekeeper/prose-lane-available.py" "<local_path>"`
before claiming it. `exit 2` (unavailable) → **skip this package** exactly
like a blocked one: leave the card in **Todo**, cut no worktree, start no
session, record `skipped: prose lane not installed`, continue. A session
started on a skill that does not exist would burn the `failed` retry and end
in Question for something a human fixes with one settings line.

**Gate on the previous package — verify, do not assume.** Here "previous
package" means the last package this run actually *processed*, in the
dependency order from Step 1a — not necessarily the one immediately before it
in board order. Skip this for the first package processed in the run (Step
0's pre-flight already swept every carried-over `pkg/*` PR).

```
still_open = list_prs(project_id, status="open", head="pkg/<prev id>-<prev slug>", limit=5)
```

- **empty** → proceed; either the previous package merged, or it never opened
  a PR (`blocked`/`failed` before Phase 5) — either way this worktree's base
  is honest.
- **not empty**, and the previous package's latest event is `ci-green` → one
  more merge attempt, the full 2c classification below, before continuing.
  If it merges, proceed normally.
- **not empty** and it still will not merge → **continue anyway**, and record
  `sequencing: package <n-1> left PR #<x> open` in the report exactly once.
  From here the run knowingly cuts this worktree from a base that lacks
  `<n-1>`; the conflict retry in 2c handles the fallout. Do not stop the run,
  do not skip the remaining packages, and do not "fix" this by parallelising.

- Branch name: `pkg/<id>-<slug>` (slug = title, lower-case, `[^a-z0-9]+` → `-`,
  trimmed, max 40 chars).
- **Find the branch before claiming the package**, in this order:
  1. A worktree a crashed attempt left for that branch → you will reuse it;
     skip the check below. How to find and identify it: the agent-worktree
     skill, "Identity and re-entry guarantees".
  2. No worktree left → run, and read its one stdout line and its exit code:

     ```
     python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/package-branch.py" "<local_path>" "pkg/<id>-<slug>"
     ```

     - **exit 0** (`branch: existing`) → the branch already exists, locally or
       on `origin`; the script has made it a local branch at its tip. Create
       the worktree **without** `base`.
     - **exit 3** (`branch: new`) → the branch exists nowhere. Create the
       worktree with `base=<default branch>`.
     - **exit 1** (`error: …`) → **skip this package**: leave the card in
       **Todo**, cut no worktree, start no session, record
       `skipped: branch check failed: <error line>`, continue. Never read an
       error as `new`: a fresh cut from the default branch would discard any
       commits the branch already carries.
- `update_ticket(project_id, ticket_id, custom_fields={"Status": <native Doing>}, response="light")`. Every `update_ticket` and `merge_pr` in this skill passes `response="light"` — a light echo (`seretos-agents/agent-project-issues#314`) — and reads nothing out of them but `pull_request.merged` and, on a merge, `pull_request.merge_commit_sha`.
- Reuse the left-over worktree, or create it as the check decided:
  - exit 0 → `worktree_create(repo_root=<local_path>, branch="pkg/<id>-<slug>")`,
    no `base` — the branch carries the package's commits from an earlier run
    or another machine, and re-cutting it from the default branch discards
    them.
  - exit 3 → `worktree_create(repo_root=<local_path>, branch="pkg/<id>-<slug>", base=<default branch>)`.
    Keep `base` here: without it a new branch is cut from whatever
    `<local_path>` has checked out.

  Take `path` from the record, and keep its id for removal.

**b. Start the package session — yourself, from this turn.** No subagent
wraps the process: a task-notification for a backgrounded Bash command is
delivered to the **main** session, and a subagent that ends its turn to wait
is terminated, not suspended (lower plugin #83/#88). So **you** start the
process, with `Bash(run_in_background: true)`, through the bundled script —
never by typing the `claude` command yourself:

```
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/start-package-session.sh" [--lane prose] <project_id> <id> "<worktree_path>" <default branch> <attempt>
```

**The lane picks the entry, and nothing else.** Read the package ticket's
labels (Step 1a's `get_ticket` already returned them). A package carrying
`lane:prose` is started with `--lane prose`, which makes the script start
`/agent-autonomous-prompt-engineer:process-prompt-engineer`; any other
package is started without the flag, exactly as before, and gets
`/agent-autonomous-developer:process-developer`. The gatekeeper derived the
label from the package's paths (`scripts/gatekeeper/classify-lane.py`); you
never judge a lane yourself and never pass a skill name — the script owns the
lane → entry table. Both entries take the same parameters and post the same
`adev:event v1` comments, so everything below — event reading, the pre-retry
CI check, triage, the merge-outcome classification, the rebase retry, Step 0
and the 2a gate — is the same for both lanes. A re-dispatch of a package
(`attempt+1`, for any reason) always uses the same lane as its first start.

The script owns the mechanics (run directory, launch lock around the start,
stream/stderr files, exit marker — see its header) and prints `RUNDIR=…`
first, then `COST_USD=<v>`, `DURATION_MS=<v>` and `TURNS=<v>`, and
`EXIT=<code>` last. Then **stop and wait for the completion
notification**, as described in the *Waiting rule* below. Do not poll the ticket, do not read the stream, do not start
a second package. CI rounds and three review rounds all
happen inside that process; hours are normal.

**Keep this session's three values.** From the completion notification's
output, take the values of `COST_USD=`, `DURATION_MS=` and `TURNS=` for this
package and this attempt, and keep them until the comment that reacts to this
session's end is posted — they go on that comment's `ato:event` block (see
`<session>` in 2c). A line printed with nothing after `=` is an empty value;
keep it empty and never guess one. This applies to each package session you
start through this script — the first start, any `attempt+1` re-dispatch and
the rebase retry — and each new start replaces the previous session's values.
The gatekeeper split session of 2c prints the same lines, but it is not a
package session: its values are not kept and go on no block. The script's output
is the only source for them: you never read `stream.jsonl` into your context
(the orchestrator stays free of project content), not even for these numbers.
`EXIT` and `RUNDIR` are informational; `tail -n 3 "<RUNDIR>/stderr.txt"` is
allowed to classify a crash.

**c. Read the ticket, react.** The exit code is informational; the truth is
the ticket. Call

```
list_comments(project_id, ticket_id=<package>, order="desc", limit=3, body_max_chars=600)
```

and take the **first** comment whose body contains `<!-- adev:event`. If none
of the three carries it, repeat the call once with `limit=10` (same
`body_max_chars`); only if that also has none is it "no terminal event". When
the full text of a `blocked`/`failed` event is needed for a Question comment,
fetch exactly that one comment with
`get_comment(project_id, comment_id=<its id>, ticket_id=<package>)`. Parse
the block as dumb `key: value` lines (`event`, `package`, `attempt`,
`rounds`, `pr`, `ci_run`; empty = unknown; unknown keys ignored).

**Escalations, triage answers and merges also carry an `ato:event v1` block.**
External tooling counts them from that block, never from the human lines
around it. The block comes only from the bundled script, never typed by hand:

```
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run/ato-event.py" render --event <event> --package <package id> [--reason <reason>] [--pr <n>] [--merge-sha <sha>] [--cost-usd <v>] [--duration-ms <v>] [--turns <v>]
```

`<package id>` is the package ticket's id — the epic's id when the package is
an epic. Each site below spells out its exact arguments in the short form
`ato-event.py render …`; always run it as the full command above. Pass the
values a site names — the event, the reason and the other arguments come from
the site, never from you (the script owns the vocabulary,
`agent-ticket-orchestrator#63`) — plus `<session>`, which every site ends with.

**`<session>` stands for `--cost-usd <v> --duration-ms <v> --turns <v>`**,
filled from the one package session whose end this comment reacts to — the
values kept in step 2b. Each session's values go on at most one block: once a
comment carrying them is posted, they are spent. Fill `<session>` with empty
values (`--cost-usd "" --duration-ms "" --turns ""`) when no package session of
this run whose values are still unposted precedes the comment — a Step 0
pre-flight reaction to an earlier run's PR, the 2a gate's repeated merge of a
package whose earlier comment already carried its values, or the
`split-failed` escalation after a gatekeeper split session. Never copy another
session's numbers into an empty slot, and never add sessions together. Put
the script's stdout verbatim into the body of the comment that site names,
**after** that comment's existing text; the block replaces no line of it. If
the script exits non-zero, post the comment anyway with its `error: …` line
where the block would go, and carry on with the column move or close exactly
as planned: a statistics block never holds up an escalation or a close.

Then react to the latest event:

| latest event | you do |
|---|---|
| `ci-green` | `merge_pr(project_id, pr_id=<pr>, response="light")`, no `merge_method`. Children of an epic close through `Closes #<n>` in the PR body — you do not close them. **Verify `pull_request.merged == true` in the response** before treating it as merged. Then **record the merge** (below), then **close the package ticket** (below), then `worktree_remove(environment_id=<id>)`. If the call errors or returns `merged: false`: **classify before reacting** — see *When the merge fails* below. Every other place in this skill that runs "the `ci-green` reaction" — Step 0, the 2a gate, the pre-retry CI check, the rebase retry — runs this whole row, the merge record included. |
| `blocked` | Triage before you retry or escalate — see *Blocked events are triaged before they cost a retry* below. |
| `failed`, or no terminal event (non-zero exit, or the latest event is a non-terminal one like `pr-opened`/`ci-red`/`review-verdict` — the process died mid-pipeline) | **First**, if a PR already exists for this package, run *The pre-retry CI check* below — it can resolve the package (straight to the `ci-green` reaction) without spending the retry. Only when that check does not resolve it: **one** fresh start (step b, same script) with `attempt+1`, same worktree. If that ends `ci-green` → handle as above. If still `failed`/none → `add_comment` summarising both attempts (event, `rounds` with the findings-vs-infra split, `pr`, both `RUNDIR`s), followed by the block of `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason failed <session>`, → **Question**, `worktree_remove`. |

**Close the package ticket — only after a verified merge.** One call on the
package ticket, the epic when the package is an epic:

```
update_ticket(project_id, ticket_id=<package>, status=<closed>, response="light")
```

`<closed>` is the provider's closed status value; which value that is, per
provider, is in the agent-project-issues skill, "Pull requests: closing the
ticket on merge" — never hardcode one. The call is idempotent: a single
ticket may already be closed by its own `Closes #<n>` line, and closing it
again changes nothing, so make the call anyway. An epic is never closed by
its PR — only its children are — so without this call a finished epic
would stay open forever. You do not close the children. Add the package id
to `done_this_run`. This close is the only place this skill records a
finished package; there is no finished column to move the card to.

**Record the merge — after the verified merge, before the close.** One
`add_comment` on the package ticket (the epic when the package is an epic):
the line `Merged PR #<pr> (<sha>).`, followed by the block of

```
ato-event.py render --event merged --package <package id> --pr <pr> --merge-sha <sha> <session>
```

`<sha>` is `pull_request.merge_commit_sha` from the `merge_pr` response when
it carries one. When it does not, call `get_pr(project_id, pr_id=<pr>)` once
— read-only — and take its `pull_request.merge_commit_sha`; for a PR the
merge-failure table finds already merged, the `get_pr` you just made is that
call. If that is empty too, pass `--merge-sha ""`, write the line as
`Merged PR #<pr>.`, and post the comment anyway: never skip it, or the merge
goes uncounted.

A `pr-opened` or `ci-red` event seen *while the process is still alive* is
not terminal — but you never see that state, because you only act after
the process has ended. CI waiting is the lower plugin's job,
inside its own process. If the latest event after the process ended is
`pr-opened` or `ci-red`, the process died mid-CI-loop: that is the "none"
row above.

**Blocked events are triaged before they cost a retry.** A `blocked` event means the lower plugin
genuinely could not decide something — but "genuinely could not decide" and "a retry would change
nothing" are not the same fact, and the old unconditional path (set aside, one full retry session
at the end of the run, no matter what) spent a whole session on cases that told us in their own
text that a retry was pointless. Incident, `agent-project-issues` package #265
(`agent-ticket-orchestrator#7`): the `blocked` event's own text predicted a Codex re-review would
"very likely just exhaust the cap without new information" — a human who happened to be watching
answered it from the ticket comment alone, no retry session needed.

So instead of setting the package aside:

1. Dispatch the **triage** subagent (fresh, unnamed, synchronous) with the `blocked` event's
   question, options, recommendation, what was already checked and its `attempt:` value, plus
   `project_id`, `package`, `local_path` and `lane=<code|prose>` (`prose` when the package
   carries `lane:prose`). It reads ticket, comments, siblings and code — the same test the `clarifier`
   already applies to Backlog questions — and ends `STATUS: ANSWERED` (a chosen option plus
   reasoning) or `STATUS: ESCALATE` (why it is not answerable from context).
2. **`ANSWERED`, and the answer carries no `<!-- triage:split v1` block** →
   `add_comment(project_id, ticket_id=<package>, body=…)` with heading
   `## Blocked triage (run)`, the question, the chosen option, and the reasoning, followed by
   the block of
   `ato-event.py render --event triage-answered --package <package id> <session>`
   — then immediately re-dispatch (step 2b, same script, `attempt+1`, same worktree). The lower plugin's
   `context-extractor` re-reads the ticket transcript on the next attempt and picks the answer up;
   no change to its contract. Do **not** wait for every other Todo package to have its turn first —
   the whole point is that nothing about this answer changes by waiting.
3. **`ANSWERED`, and the answer carries a `<!-- triage:split v1 … -->` block** → the prose lane
   found requirements it may not build, and the answer is to split them into a code ticket. A
   re-dispatch would hit the same wall, so the split replaces it:
   1. `add_comment(project_id, ticket_id=<package>, body=…)` with heading
      `## Blocked triage (run)`, the question, the chosen option, the reasoning, and the
      `triage:split v1` block copied verbatim from triage's answer, followed by the block of
      `ato-event.py render --event triage-answered --package <package id> <session>`.
      The `triage:split v1` block is what the gatekeeper reads; it ignores the `ato:event`
      block, which carries a different marker.
   2. `worktree_remove(environment_id=<id>)`. Do not move the card — it stays in **Doing** — and
      do not re-dispatch the package here.
   3. Start exactly one gatekeeper split session, yourself, with `Bash(run_in_background: true)`:

      ```
      bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/start-package-session.sh" --gatekeeper-split <project_id> <package> "<local_path>"
      ```

      It runs the gatekeeper on this one ticket, from the main checkout, with the two arguments
      that let it file the code half and move both tickets to Todo. Then stop and wait for the
      completion notification exactly as in step 2b. While it runs, the gatekeeper is the
      ticket's one writer: you do not comment on it or move it.
   4. Scan the headings with
      `list_comments(project_id, ticket_id=<package>, order="desc", limit=20, body_max_chars=200)`.
      For a `## Lane split (gatekeeper)` comment **newer than your `## Blocked triage (run)`
      comment**, fetch that one comment in full with
      `get_comment(project_id, comment_id=<its id>, ticket_id=<package>)`. When its
      `gatekeeper:lane` block carries `code_ticket: #<n>`, the split landed: note
      `split: code half #<n>` on this package's report row, and drop its memoised
      `blockers[p]` (Step 1a, item 2). The split session has already put both tickets where
      they belong (Todo, or Question when the gatekeeper had to ask); you move neither. The
      next iteration's fresh order picks up whatever landed in Todo: the code half first, and
      the original only after the code half is closed, because the original is now
      `blocked_by` it. The original then goes out as a new dispatch — step a from the top,
      `attempt+1`, same lane. Triage-once still holds for it: a second `blocked` event is
      `triage-reblocked` (item 5). A ticket the gatekeeper parked in Question is not in Todo
      and is not picked up.
   5. No such comment, or its block carries no `code_ticket:` → `add_comment` with one line — *"Escalated: the gatekeeper split session
      ended without a lane split — see the `triage:split` block above."* — followed by the block of
      `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason split-failed <session>`,
      → **Question**, note `split-failed`. The `triage:split v1` block stays on the ticket, so the next gatekeeper pass a human starts
      finds the card and applies the split into Planned.
4. **`ESCALATE`** → `add_comment` with the original question plus one line — *"Escalated: not
   answerable from ticket, comments or code — see the blocked event above."* — followed by the
   block of
   `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason blocked <session>`,
   → **Question**, `worktree_remove`. Do not spend a retry session on a question triage already told you a retry
   cannot resolve.
5. **Triage once per package per run.** Before dispatching triage, check whether this package's
   ticket already carries a `## Blocked triage (run)` comment from earlier in this run
   (`list_comments(project_id, ticket_id=<package>, order="desc", limit=20, body_max_chars=200)`,
   search for the heading). If it does, a second `blocked` event goes straight to
   the `ESCALATE` reaction above, with its block rendered by
   `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason triage-reblocked <session>`
   in place of the `--reason blocked` one — a triage-answered redispatch that blocks again means the answer
   did not hold or a materially different question surfaced, and either way a second guess is not
   this system's to make alone. The split session of item 3 inherits this bound: it takes the
   place of the triage-driven re-dispatch, so a package gets at most one of the two per run.

This replaces the old two-stage design entirely: there is no more "second pass at the end of the
run" for `blocked` packages, and `blocked_list` does not exist. A `blocked` event is triaged the
moment it is read, in board order, exactly like every other reaction in this step.

**When the merge fails — classify before reacting.**

A merge failure is not one thing. Call `get_pr(project_id, pr_id=<pr>)`
**once** and read `pull_request` — its `mergeable_state` and the merge error
text. The *what you see* entries below are the cause categories of the
agent-project-issues skill, "Pull requests: why a merge is blocked", which
maps each provider's values onto them. If the state is *not computed yet*,
`Bash("sleep 20")` once and fetch a **second and
last** time — never a third; where that skill says the value never fills, do
not fetch a second time, classify from the error text. Then, in this order:

| what you see | what it is | you do |
|---|---|---|
| already merged | already merged — a race, or a human merged it by hand | treat as a successful merge: record the merge (the `get_pr` above supplies `merge_commit_sha`), close the package ticket, `worktree_remove`. Note `merged externally` in the report. |
| conflict, or the merge error text names a conflict | **conflict** — the base moved | **the rebase retry** below. Not a Question. |
| behind | base moved, no textual conflict, but the branch is not up to date | **the rebase retry** below — the session finds a clean rebase and goes straight to push + CI. |
| gate open: CI, review or draft | branch protection, a required review, a required check | `add_comment` with the exact error and the `mergeable_state`, followed by the block of `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason merge-failed <session>`, move the card to **Question**, `worktree_remove`, record `merge-failed` in the report. A human decides. |
| a permission error (`pulls.merge`, 403, "not permitted") | permission | `add_comment` with the exact error, followed by the block of `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason merge-failed <session>`, move the card to **Question**, `worktree_remove`, record `merge-failed` (reachable only if the permission was revoked mid-run; Precondition 3 refuses the project otherwise). |
| not computed yet, still after the second fetch, and the error text names nothing | unknown | `add_comment` carrying the block of `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason merge-failed <session>`, **Question**, `worktree_remove`, `merge-failed (state unknown)`. Never guess a conflict from silence — a wrong guess costs a whole session. |

A **conflict is mechanical** and belongs to this system. Everything else on
this table is a decision or a configuration, and belongs to a human. See
*Why "retry" is never a valid Question*.

**The pre-retry CI check — waiting is not failing.** A process can end on `failed` or a
non-terminal event for a reason that has nothing to do with the package: it can die while a gating
CI run has not finished yet, or even after that run has already finished green, simply because
the session ended before it read the result. Two independent incidents escalated to Question on
exactly this (`agent-ticket-orchestrator#8`): `agent-worktree` package #165 (one CI run green,
the other still executing when the session exited) and `agent-project-issues` package #268 (**both**
gating runs had already completed successfully before the session exited — there was nothing left
to wait for, let alone decide). Before spending the `failed`/no-terminal-event retry:

1. If the latest event carries a `pr:` value, or `list_prs(project_id, head="pkg/<id>-<slug>",
   status="open", limit=5)` finds one, call `get_pr(project_id, pr_id=<pr>)` once and
   `list_pipeline_runs(project_id, commit_sha=<pr.head.sha>, limit=20)`. Read the runs per the
   agent-project-issues skill, "Reading a run's `status` and `conclusion`".
2. **The head commit is CI-green**, and `mergeable_state` does not read as a conflict per
   the table above → the package is finished in every way that matters even though the process
   never said so. Go straight to the `ci-green` reaction (merge, verify `merged: true`, record the merge, close the package ticket)
   **without spending the retry**.
3. **At least one run has not finished** → the package is only waiting.
   `Bash("sleep 60")` once and re-check — the same one-more-look pattern the merge classification
   above already uses, never a third check here either. Still not finished → *now* the ordinary
   retry applies (step b, `attempt+1`); this is one extra look, not an unbounded wait, and it does
   not conflict with *Waiting rule* below (that rule is about never polling CI in place of the
   lower plugin's own Phase 6 loop — this is a single, bounded recheck of a process that has
   already ended, not a wait *inside* a running process).
4. **A run failed** → this is a genuine `failed`; the ordinary retry applies unchanged.
5. **No PR exists yet for this package** → nothing to check; the ordinary retry applies unchanged.

**The rebase retry.** One attempt, once per package per run — a budget
independent of the `failed`-retry budget above and the triage-driven
re-dispatch a `blocked` event can trigger (see *Merge outcomes are classified,
and a conflict is a retry* below for why they do not share a counter).

1. **Reuse the worktree.** You have not removed it yet at this point in 2c,
   and it is on `pkg/<id>-<slug>` with the package's commits. Do **not**
   remove and re-create it. If it is genuinely gone (this `run` resumed after
   a crash), reuse the worktree left for that branch; only if there is none,
   `worktree_create(repo_root=<local_path>, branch="pkg/<id>-<slug>")` —
   **omit `base`**, the branch already exists remotely. Finding it and its
   id: the agent-worktree skill, "Identity and re-entry guarantees". Never
   re-cut the branch from the default branch: that discards the package's
   commits.
2. **Dispatch, exactly as in step 2b**, same script, `attempt+1`. No extra
   argument to the script or the lower plugin: the lower plugin orients
   itself on the branch (an open PR plus green CI on this exact HEAD plus a
   base that moved means "repair only" to it — see the lower plugin's
   `AGENTS.md`, "Phase 0 orients on the branch instead of taking a
   parameter"). Then stop and wait for the completion notification, exactly
   as step 2b. A repair session is short but goes through the CI gate as well — budget
   the same 45-minute rounds.
3. **React to the new latest event.**
   - `ci-green` → back to the top of the `ci-green` row: `merge_pr(…, response="light")`, verify
     `merged: true`, record the merge, close the package ticket, `worktree_remove`. Note `merged after
     rebase` in the report.
   - `ci-green` and the merge fails **again** → stop. `add_comment` naming
     both merge attempts, both `mergeable_state` values and both `RUNDIR`s,
     followed by the block of
     `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason merge-conflict <session>`
     → **Question**, `worktree_remove`, note `merge-conflict` in the report.
   - `blocked` → the resolution needs a product decision (two packages
     implemented incompatible behaviour) — the rebase retry's own single
     attempt is already spent, so this does not also draw on the triage
     mechanism below (that budget is for the *primary* `blocked` reaction,
     not a second one inside an already-spent repair attempt). `add_comment`
     with one line — *"Escalated after a rebase attempt: the conflict
     resolution is a decision — see the blocked event above."* — followed by
     the block of
     `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason rebase-decision <session>`
     → **Question**, `worktree_remove`.
   - `failed`, or no terminal event → `add_comment` with the failure summary
     and both `RUNDIR`s, followed by the block of
     `ato-event.py render --event escalated --package <package id> --reason failed <session>`
     → **Question**, `worktree_remove`. **Do not** spend
     the `failed`-retry budget on a repair session — it already had its own
     budget, in step 2.

**`ci-green` outranks everything.** Before moving any card to **Question**
for any reason, re-read its latest `adev:event`. If it is `ci-green`, the
package's *work* is finished and only the merge is left — the only reactions
available to you are exactly this classification table and nothing else.
Never write Question for a reason unrelated to the merge, never leave a
`ci-green` package in **Doing**, and never carry a stale escalation from an
earlier attempt forward past a later `ci-green`. Only the **latest** event
counts — that is why you always read `list_comments(order="desc", limit=3, body_max_chars=600)` and take
the *first* `adev:event`, before every decision, including a triage-driven
re-dispatch and every escalation.

**d. Worktree removal.** Always `worktree_remove(environment_id=…)`; on a
Windows directory lock follow the agent-worktree skill's recipe for it; if it
still fails, record the path under *manual cleanup* in the report and
continue. A stuck worktree never blocks the next package.

### 3. Final report

One table: `package · result (Done / Question / Skipped) · note · PR
· rounds (from the last event's `rounds`) · attempts`. `Done` in the result
column means the PR merged and the package ticket is closed — a result, not a
column. One row per package, showing its final outcome in this run, however
many iterations it took. A package the gatekeeper split session split (2c,
*Blocked events are triaged*) keeps one row: its result is where it ended —
`Done` if its later session merged, `Question` if it ended there, `Skipped` if
it is still in Todo — and its note is `split: code half #<n>` followed by the
note of that later outcome, if any (for example
`split: code half #<n>; skipped: blocked by #<n> (not closed)`). The code half
has a row of its own. `note` is empty for a
clean Done, and otherwise one of: `merged after rebase`, `merged externally`,
`merge-conflict`, `merge-failed`, `blocked-escalated`,
`manual cleanup: <path>`, `skipped: blocked by #<b> (not closed)`,
`skipped: blocker #<b> ended in <column>`, `skipped: blocker #<b> skipped`,
`skipped: prose lane not installed`, `skipped: branch check failed: <error line>`,
`split: code half #<n>`, `split-failed`.
Above the table, one line per carried-over PR found by the Step 0 pre-flight,
one line per sequencing violation observed during the run, and one line per
dependency cycle found in Step 1a, once per run (`dependency cycle: #a -> #b -> #a,
processed in board order`) — all named above.

The run is **SUCCESS only if every package reached Done**. Anything else is
**PARTIAL** with the list of what is not Done and which column it sits in. A
split original counts toward PARTIAL only if it did not end Done. A skipped
package makes the run PARTIAL, correctly — it is not Done. But it is a
**benign** partial that names its own blocker and its own next step, unlike a
failure; do not blur the two in the report. Never silently drop a package,
and never write a "not included" list into any PR — the PR belongs to the
lower plugin and describes one package only.

## Waiting rule

This skill never waits on a human and never polls CI. The only thing it ever
waits on is the completion notification of a `claude -p` process it
started itself: a package session (step 2b), or the one gatekeeper split
session of step 2c. Everything slower than that (CI rounds of up to 45
minutes, three review rounds) happens *inside* that process. So a single
package can occupy you for hours; that is fine. Do not start a second
package to "use the time".

The completion notification is the wake. If a fallback wake-up is scheduled at all while a package session
runs, it is 3600 s, never shorter, and it is not a poll: it reads nothing.

## Why there is no dollar budget

`--max-budget-usd` used to cap each package session at $15. It is gone, and it
should not come back in that shape. Four reasons, all measured on the
2026-08-23/24 runs (32 sessions, 14 packages, five projects):

1. **It regulated the wrong quantity.** The figure Claude Code reports is API
   *list price*, which is not what a subscription is billed. Those 32 sessions
   came to $251 list and consumed roughly 23 percentage points of a weekly
   subscription limit — so the $15 cap was about 1.4% of that week's budget,
   not the third it reads like. A ceiling denominated in a currency nobody in
   the loop is actually spending cannot be set correctly by anyone.
2. **It did not hold.** The check only lands between turns: one package
   finished at **$18.40 against a $15 cap** (+23%), while exactly one of the
   32 sessions ever tripped the abort. A ceiling that is 23% porous in one
   direction and near-inert in the other buys no safety.
3. **It aborted at the most expensive possible moment.** The spend is front-
   loaded — context, planning, two critic gates, test-first implementation —
   so an abort after the implementation and before the PR discards everything
   already paid for, and the retry pays for orientation again. Of the $251,
   **$152 (61%) went on attempts that never reached `ci-green`**; the cheapest
   successful attempts were the ones that inherited a worktree with committed
   work in it. Forcing an abort there is the most costly behaviour available.
4. **It manufactured Questions the section below forbids.** A card whose
   comment says "budget was too small" leaves a human exactly one sensible
   move — raise it and put the card back in Todo. That is a retry wearing a
   decision's clothes.

The platform's own session limits already stop a runaway, at a boundary the
platform owns and enforces consistently. Cost control belongs in the pipeline's
shape — fewer dead attempts, work committed so a retry resumes instead of
restarting, the session's own turn on a model that fits what it does — not in a
second ceiling that fires mid-flight. If a package genuinely never terminates,
that is a bug in the lower plugin's round caps, and it is fixed there.

## Why "retry" is never a valid Question

The escalation rule of the ecosystem says a human is asked only for a
**decision**, never for a **retry**. Every level below you — the lower plugin's
plan-critic, test-critic, review and CI gates with their three-round caps, and
this skill's own second attempt — already does the retrying. By the time a
card reaches `Question`, the ticket comment must state a real fork: a
trade-off the ticket and the code do not settle, or an error with two attempts'
worth of evidence that it is not transient. If a human opens a Question card
and the only sensible reaction is "move it back to Todo and kick it again",
then one of the levels skipped its own attempt — that is a **bug in this
system**, to be fixed in the level that forwarded instead of trying, not a
workflow for the human.

A merge conflict is the canonical case this section was written for. The base
moved because another package merged first — nobody made a choice, nothing
about the ticket is in question, and the fix (rebase, resolve, re-verify,
re-push, re-merge) is exactly as mechanical as a red CI run. Treating it as a
Question, as this skill used to, put "move it back to Todo and kick it again"
in a human's hands for a problem this system was always capable of absorbing
itself. See *Merge outcomes are classified, and a conflict is a retry* below.

## Merge outcomes are classified, and a conflict is a retry

**Incident, 2026-08-24, `agent-web-tester`.** Package #4 reached `ci-green`
(PR #14) but sat behind a stale `Question` escalation left over from before
`--max-budget-usd` was removed, so it never merged. Because #4 never merged,
package #5's worktree was cut from the **old** default branch and ran its
full cycle in parallel with #4's still-open PR — the "never two open PRs"
guarantee (see § 2's rationale) silently did not hold, because nothing checked
it. A human merged #14 by hand; #5 then also reached `ci-green` (PR #16), but
by then the base had moved and PR #16 came back `mergeable_state: dirty`. The
only reaction available under the old contract was to park #16 and
report `merge-failed` — a dead end that needed a human to rebase it by hand,
for a conflict that carried no decision at all.

Three changes close that hole, all documented at their point of use above:

- **Step 0's pre-flight** finishes any `ci-green` package an earlier run left
  unmerged, *before* enumerating Todo — the exact situation package #4 was
  stuck in.
- **Step 2a's gate** verifies the previous package actually cleared before
  cutting the next worktree, instead of assuming the sequencing guarantee
  held.
- **Step 2c's merge-outcome classification** tells a conflict (mechanical,
  this system's job) apart from branch protection, a missing permission, or
  an unresolved state (all still a human's job), and gives the conflict case
  exactly one rebase retry before it, too, becomes a Question.

**Independent retry budgets, not a shared counter:** one `failed`/
no-terminal-event retry (2c, now preceded by the pre-retry CI check, which
does not itself spend the budget), one rebase retry (the conflict path), and
one triage-driven re-dispatch when a `blocked` event turns out to be
`ANSWERED` — or, when that answer carries a `triage:split v1` block, one
gatekeeper split session in its place (also 2c — see *Blocked events are
triaged before they cost a retry*, above). A package can legitimately reach `attempt=3` — failed once,
`ci-green` on the second try, conflicted and rebased on the third — and
`attempt` stays a monotonically increasing session counter across all of it,
exactly as it already was. **Hard ceiling: at most three package sessions per
package per run, at most one of which is a rebase session, at most one of
which is a triage-driven re-dispatch.** The split session is not a package
session and does not raise `attempt`; it uses up the triage-driven
re-dispatch's slot. The split original may be dispatched once more in this
run, after its code half closes, within the same three-session ceiling. A shared counter would reproduce the exact dead
end this incident describes: a package that spent its one retry on an earlier
crash, then reached `ci-green`, then had nothing left for a purely mechanical
conflict.

The lower plugin (`agent-autonomous-developer`) makes the rebase retry
possible: its `process-developer` skill orients on the branch itself (an open
PR, green CI on the exact current HEAD, and a base that moved means "repair
only" to it) rather than taking a parameter from this skill — see its
`AGENTS.md`, "Phase 0 orients on the branch instead of taking a parameter".
That is why step 2c's rebase retry dispatches with the **same script call**
as an ordinary retry, just `attempt+1`.

## Hard rules

- **No `AskUserQuestion`.** The tool is not granted to this skill and there is
  nobody to answer. A question becomes a ticket comment plus a `Question`
  card.
- **Unnamed dispatches only.** Every `Agent` call is synchronous and without
  `name`; never `SendMessage`, never resume. Retry = fresh dispatch with
  `attempt+1`.
- **One writer per ticket during a session.** While a package session or a
  gatekeeper split session is running, you do not comment on or move that
  ticket. The session writes; you react afterwards.
- **The gatekeeper is started only as the split session.** Only for a triage
  `ANSWERED` that carries a `triage:split v1` block, only through
  `start-package-session.sh --gatekeeper-split`, and at most once per package
  per run (2c). Every other gatekeeper pass is a human's to start.
- **Never edit code**, never run tests, never open or push branches yourself.
  `Edit`/`Write` are not part of this skill's job even if available.
- **Never touch Backlog or Planned.** Never move anything *out of* Question —
  that direction is human-only (→ Todo or → Backlog).
- **Column writes plus the one close are the status channel; comments only where this skill says**
  (failure summary before → Question, the one-line escalation, the
  `## Blocked triage (run)` comment, the one-line `split-failed` escalation, the
  merge-failed notes, the merge-outcome
  classification's own comments: both merge attempts on a persisted conflict,
  the one-line escalation after a `blocked` rebase — and the `Merged PR #<pr>`
  record after every successful merge). The `ato:event v1` block is part of
  these comments, never a comment of its own.
- **Project id comes from the repo's `origin`** (or an explicit argument) and is
  threaded into every call; it is never guessed from a name.
- **Sequential.** One package at a time, one process at a time.
- **The lane is a label, and it only picks the entry.** `lane:prose` →
  `--lane prose`; no label → no flag. Never decide a lane yourself, never
  pass a skill name to the script, and never branch on the lane anywhere else.
- **`ci-green` outranks everything.** A package whose latest event is
  `ci-green` may only be reacted to via the 2c merge-outcome classification —
  never moved to Question for an unrelated reason, never left in Doing, never
  judged by a stale earlier event. See *Merge outcomes are classified, and a
  conflict is a retry*.
- **A merge conflict is a retry, not a Question.** One rebase attempt, same
  script, `attempt+1`, before it escalates. Branch protection, a missing
  permission, and an unresolved mergeability state remain human-only.
- **A blocked package is skipped, never reordered past its blocker and never
  escalated.** It stays in Todo; the next run picks it up once the blocker
  is closed. A blocker still in Todo is no skip: 1a orders the package after
  it, and a later iteration of this run takes it once this run closes the
  blocker. See *1a. Order Todo by dependency*.
- **A dependency cycle never stops the night.** Report it, process the
  cycle's members in board order at the end, continue.
